Issues:
-

TODO:
- Common bathroom card based on BedroomCard component. Has type, level and then details with Chip // Done
- Common area beds // Done
- Make Pool tab conditional based on basic info checkbox // Done

- Place a warning on both advanced view and go to basic buttons explaining to the user what will happen when they will press each button.


- BasicInfo: {
    - Max property occupancy: {
        - Max adults and max children should not be activated until max number of persons is first updated. Then they should become available for editing.
        - Max number of persons: Add -/+ buttons so the user can determine how many people the property can accept.
        - Max adults should take at least 1 adult minimum and the same number as max persons as its max value. The user should manually add how many adults are allowed.
        - Max children should take zero (0) as the minimal value and -1 from max adults as its max value so that at least one adult can visit alongside the alloted number of children.}
    - Move Property Location to Main Description
}
- Main Description: {
    - Lose the accordions on first two sections
    - Move Living space information on top of Lodging type
    - Format the newly moved Property Location to accept GPS coordinates in a fashion that accepts only numbers and dots (.). You can hardcode the dots and you should also move the textfields closer to each other.
        - Moreover, add the coordinates of the property into a link that once clicked will take the user to google maps to check the accuracy of their location. EASYMODE
        - Or make a google maps programmer account and figure out how to embed the map onto the form (requires some kind of paid access so research it) HARDMODE
    - Make brief description occupy the length of the form space
}
- Outside: {
    - Make kiosk into a checkbox
    - Add InfoIcon to bbq textbox that reads "e.g. charcoal, grill etc"
    - Sun and shade, make these four into checkboxes with conditional textboxes
}
- BedsNBaths: {
    - On BedroomCard remove the bedroom type and the ensuite type. Also add a label over Heating that reads "select all that apply". Also add -/+ buttons so the user may also add 
bedrooms manually without having to go back to Basic Info and readjust the dropdown list (in short make it more intuitive) and then have the number of bedroom cards update the bedroomNumber variable ex post facto.
    - On common area beds: Make each level able to host up to 2 max common area beds and stack the levels horizontally next to each other.
    - On common baths lose the type and keep only subtypes. Then make each dropdown a chip with a label "Choose all that apply". 
    However the user should be able to select an item within the chip more than once (example of two 'headed' showers in Turkey)
    - Number of bathrooms should be first defined by the user on a dropdown on Basic Info but ALSO 
adapt if the user adds more or less under beds and baths dynamically (basically some kind of baths.length)
}
- Extras: Rename Beds and baths extras into "Baby extras"
- CSS styles: {
    - Emphasize on the mobile inteface. Make it as user friendly as possible. Add hamburger for tabs on top right corner and after you do, add the tab name over the back/next buttons so the user always knows where they are.
}
- Add required field and test how they interact // Figured it out but going to implement it last
- Make the form a bit more conservative, colors should be more light/smooth/discreet/conservative. Make tabs a bit glossy on hover and also on hover there should be a highlighted text description for PC/Laptop.
- Add tab flavor texts (on main category) on all tabs or consider leaving it empty with just the category heading. It should be descriptive enough
- Ask Alastair how to deploy this to a server or figure it out yourself (;-)
- Make an account on eos and see the cookie it sends
OPTIONAL
- Find/create icons for each element
