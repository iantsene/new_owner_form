## Multi-step form page for new villa owners 
This project is a front-end page created to serve as the initiation point of new villa owners for a villa renting business. The point is to fill in the information and by the end export everything to the backend as JSON for archiving.

## How to run it locally

After cloning the project perform 'npm install' on your vscode terminal to install dependencies and run the development server using command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx` or the React components under `src/components` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
